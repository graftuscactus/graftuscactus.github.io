									<h1>Care instructions for your grafted cacti</h1>
								</header>
								<ul>
										<li><b>Plant in well-draining soil.</b> Commercial cactus soil is okay, though I prefer to just use a half and half mixture of perlite and any other commercial soil mix such as miracle grow or pro-mix. Adding perlite to your soil will increase drainage and keep the roots from staying wet for too long.</li>
										<li><b>Slowly acclimate cactus to natural sunlight</b> if you plan to have it outdoors in full sun. Increase amount of natural full sunlight by about 1 hour per day (starting from 1 hour) to avoid sunburn when you first receive the cactus. </li>
										<li><b>Be careful of the spines</b> on the graft and on the grafting stock (they hurt!).</li>
										<li><b>Do not worry if the Pereskiopsis drops some of its leaves</b> during shipping, this will not affect the growth of your grafted cactus. If the pereskiopsis ever puts off a shoot to grow more pereskiopsis, you can remove it to cause the pereskiopsis to put all of its energy into the grafted cactus.</li>
										<li><b>Allow the surface of the soil to dry out </b>between watering. It can help to plant the cactus in a clay pot, but I use plastic and they work fine as long as your pot has drainage in the bottom and you allow soil to dry between waterings.</li>
										<li>Feel free to email at <b>graftuscactus@gmail.com</b> with any questions or concerns.</li>
